Basic C and Terminal:

1. Write a program that prints out both the area and the perimeter of a rectangle with the given dimensions:
7.5’’ by 11’’ 
8’’ by 4’’
Example:
When given values for a rectangle that is 2’’ by 3’’ the program prints:

        Perimeter  Area
 Rectangle 1:     10          6

























2. How do you write single line and block comments in C?




3. To practice terminal commands (cd, mv, less, ls, pwd, ect) play Terminus (http://www.mprat.org/Terminus/).

4. Follow-up on File Permissions (Not expected knowledge, simply interesting):
Suppose you are in Prof. Walker’s directory ~walker/public_html/MyroC/MyroC.3.2/MyroC.3.2a
and upon running the command “ls -l” you see the following file.
-rwxr-xr-x 1 walker mathfac  1201 Aug 21  2016 README.txt
Write the terminal commands that change the permissions of the file below to -rw-r--r--.
