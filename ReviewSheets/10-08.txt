Binary:

0.) Represent the following numbers as a 4 bit number
in two's compliment notation

A.) 5
B.) -2
C.)-7

1.) Represent the following numbers in IEEE single-precision
representation

A.) 1.0 :


B.) 3.25 :


C.) -0.125:


D.) 63.375:




Bitwise operations:

2.) Determine integer that results from
the following expressions
A.) 7 & 5
B.) 8 | 3
C.) 9 << 2
D.) 6 ^ 3
E.) ~(-3)

Unions:

3.) Suppose that s is the following structure

struct shape {
       int shape_kind;
       union
       {
       	     struct
	     {
		int height, width;
	     } rectangle;
	     struct
	     {
		int radius
	     } circle;
	}u;
} s;


Indicate which of the following statements are legal, and show how to
repair the ones that aren't

a.) s.shape_kind = 1;
b.) s.height=25;
c.) s.u.rectangle.width =8;
d.) s.u.circle =5;

Review:
Arrays:

4.) Write a function that takes two arrays of integers, and their
sizes, and modifies the first array to contain the minimum of
comparing them by elements.
