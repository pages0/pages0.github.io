Input and output:


1.) Suppose that we call scanf as follows:

    float x,y;
    int i;
    scanf("%f%d%f", &x, &i, &y);

    if the user enters

    12.3 45.6 789

    What will be the values of x,i, and y after the call?
    
2.) What output do the following calls of printf produce?
    a.) printf("%6d, %4d", 86, 1040);
    b.) printf("%12.5lf", 30.253);
    c.) printf("%2d%5.2lf%d", 300,0.2,1024);

Structures:
3.)
a.)Using typedef and a struct, declare a type named 
complex, with two members, real and imaginary of type double.







b.) Declare complex variables c1, and c2 with the same values. 
Initialize them in different ways.




c.) Write a function named make_complex that takes two doubles, and
returns a complex with the given parameters


complex make_complex(double real, double imaginary){





}




d.) Write a function named add_complex that takes two complex
 number and adds the corresponding members of its arguments, 
then returns the result.

complex add_complex(complex c1, complex c2){







}


4.)Assume that the "time" structure contains three 
members: hours, minutes and seconds. Write a function 
that takes a long representing the time in seconds 
since midnight, and returns a structure centaining the
 equivalent time in hours (0-23), minutes (0-59), and seconds (0-59).

struct time split_time(long total_seconds){






}

2D Arrays:

5.) Write a program fragment that declares
an 8x8 char array named checker_board then
uses a loop to store the following data into
the array

B R B R B R B R
R B R B R B R B
B R B R B R B R
R B R B R B R B
B R B R B R B R
R B R B R B R B
B R B R B R B R
R B R B R B R B
