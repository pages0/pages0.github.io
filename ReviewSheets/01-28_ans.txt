Basic C and Terminal Knowledge

1. Write a program that prints out both the area and the perimeter of a rectangle with the given dimensions:
7.5’’ by 11’’ 
8’’ by 4’’
Example:
When given values for a rectangle that is 2’’ by 3’’ the program prints:

        Perimeter  Area
 Rectangle 1:     10          6

#include <stdio.h>

int main ()
{
  /* declare variables */
  double width1, height1, perimeter1, area1;
  int width2, height2, perimeter2, area2;  

  /* initialization */
  width1 = 7.5;
  height1 = 11.0;
  width2 = 8;
  height2 = 4;
/* compute perimeters and areas */  
  perimeter1 = 2 * width1 + 2 * height1;
  perimeter2 = 2 * width2 + 2 * height2;
  area1 = width1 * height1;
  area2 = width2 * height2;
  
  /* print table of results */
  /* Notice that in the table 
 printf ("\t \t Perimeter  Area\n");  //table title
  /* report results to 1 decimal place */
  printf ("Rectangle 1:   %5.1lf %5.1lf\n", perimeter1, area1);
  printf ("Rectangle 2:   %d %d\n", perimeter2, area2);
  
  /* tell operating system "no errors" */
  return 0;
}

2. How do you write single line and block comments in C?
// for single line comments
/* */ for block comments

3. To practice terminal commands (cd, mv, less, ls, pwd, ect) play Terminus (http://www.mprat.org/Terminus/).

4. Follow-up on File Permissions (Not expected knowledge, simply interesting):
Suppose you are in Prof. Walker’s directory ~walker/public_html/MyroC/MyroC.3.2/MyroC.3.2a
and upon running the command “ls -l” you see the following file.
-rwxr-xr-x 1 walker mathfac  1201 Aug 21  2016 README.txt
Write the terminal commands that change the permissions of the file below to -rw-r--r--.

There are 3 groups we can change permissions for user, group and world. Additionally there are three capabilities each group might have, read (4), write (2), execute (1). 
Each of the 3 groups gets one number representing it’s permissions. Notice that the sum of each of the capabilities (some combination of 0 or 4, 0 or 2, and 0 or 1) is different for each combination.
