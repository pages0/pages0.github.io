Arrays:
1: What will the following program fragment output

int arr[] = {1,2,-3,4,5,8};		      
  int min, max;
  max_min(arr,4,&min,&max);
  printf("min = %d, max = %d\n", min , max);

2: What will the following program fragment output

int arr[] = {1,2,-3,4,5,8};
int* a = &arr[3];
printf("a[-2] = %d\n", a[-2]);

3: Write a function that takes two arrays of integers, and their
sizes, and modifies the first array to contain the minimum of
comparing them by elements. 










Pointers:

4:
# include <stdio.h>

void swap (int a, int b);	// 1
     	       	      		// 2
int main(void)			// 3
{   				// 4
  int i =1, j =2;		// 5
  //Point A   			// 6
  swap(i,j);			// 7
  printf("i = %d, j = %d\n", i , j);// 8
  // Point E  	      	       // 9
  return 0;		       // 10
} 	 		       // 11
			       // 12
void swap( int a , int b)      // 13
{    	       	       	       // 14
  // Point B		       //15
int temp = a;		       // 16
  // Point C 		       // 17
  a = b;     		       // 18
  b = temp;		       // 19
  // Point D		       // 20
}     			       // 21

The above program has an intended purpose of swaping i and j, and then displaying them. Is this program correct for this purpose?
If not, correct it.


5:
The following function supposedly computes the sum and average
of the numbers in the array arr, which has length n. avg and
sum point to variables that the function should modify.
Unfortunately, the function contains several errors: find and
correct them.

void avg_sum(double arr[], int n, double *avg, double sum){
{
int i;
sum = 0.0;
for (i = 0; i <n ; i++)
    sum += arr[i];
   avg = sum / n;
}


6: Write a function that takes an integer array arr, with length n,
and calculates and assigns the maximum and minimum values

void max_min(int arr[],int n,int * min, int* max){



}


7: Write a program that takes two arrays, speeds and durations each
   with length n. If the index is an even number, then the robot
   should move forward with the given speed and duration and if the
   index is odd the robot should move backward with the given speed
   and duration

void
vibrate(double speeds [] , double durations [] , int n){










}


8:Suppose
int a[] = {5, 15, 34, 54, 14, 2, 52, 72};
int *p= &a[1];
int *q=&a[5];

(a) What is the value of *(p+3)?
(b) What is the value of *(q-3)?
(c) Is the condition p < q true of false?
(d) Is the condition *p < *q true of false?

9: What will the contents of the array a be after the following code is executed?
#define N 10

int a[N] = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10};
int *p=&a[0], *q=&a[N-1], temp;

while (p < q)
{
 temp = *p;
 *p++ = *q;
 *q-- = temp;
}
