Loops:

1: What output does the follwing program fragment produce?

int i =1 ;
while (i <= 128){
  printf("%d\n ", i);
  i *=2;
}

2: Translate the above program fragment into a single for loop








3: Fix the error in the following program fragment


  if (n%2== 0);
  printf("n is even\n");


4: Extra: What is the output of the following program fragment:

int i,j;
  int counter =0;
  for (i =1 ;i <= 20; i++){
    for (j=1; j<=i; j++){
      counter++;
    }
  }
  printf ("Counter: %d\n", counter);

Could you do what this loop is doing with just one loop?
