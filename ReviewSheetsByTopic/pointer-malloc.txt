Pointers and Malloc:

1: Write a function named duplicate that uses dynamic storage
allocation to create a copy of a string. For example, the call

p = duplicate(str);

would allocate space for a string of the same length as str,
copy the contents of str into the new string, and return a
pointer to it. Have duplicate return a null pointer if the
memory allocation fails.

char * duplicate(char * str){




}



2: Write the following function:

int * create_array(int n, int initial_value);

The function should return a pointer to a dynamically
allocated array with n members, each of which is
initialized to initial_value. The return value should
be NULL if the array can't be allocated

int * create_array(int n, int initial_value){




}
