      <h2>How to play this game:</h2>
      The goal of the game is to form the corners of a square. This
      square can be along the standard grid,such as the following,
      made by white
      </p>
      <img src="gridsquare.png" alt="Grid Square" style="width:200px;height:250px">
      <p>
      or the square can tilted like one of the following.
      </p>
      
      <img src="tiltedsquare.png" alt="Tilted Square" style="width:200px;height:250px">

      <img src="knightssquare.png" alt="Kights Square" style="width:200px;height:250px">
      
      <p>
      Players alternate turns placing down pieces until one of them
      successfully forms a square.
      </p>

      <p>
      <h2>Settings:</h2>
      <h4>Board and Dimensions</h4>
      The "new board" button will generate a new board with the selected
      dimension. The undo button will undo the last move that was
      made.

      <h4>Minimum Square Size</h4>
      This option controls how large a square has to be for it to
      count as forming a square.
      The "not all touching" option is the default, doesn't count
      squares where all corners are adjacent like the following      
      </p>

      <img src="smallSquare.png" alt="Small Square" style="width:200px;height:250px">
      
      <p>
      The "not touching" option doesn't count a square in which
      any corners touch. This prevents the square above
      from counting, and prevents the following from counting as well.
      </p>
      
      <img src="tiltedsquare.png" alt="Tilted Square"
      style="width:200px;height:250px">
      

      <p>The final option is "any size". This option counts a square
      of any size. All of the above options are implemented after
      board has been refreshed by pressing the "new board" button.</p>

      <p>
      <h4>Checkable options</h4>
      There are two options that can be checked on and off, show move
      numbers, and show forced squares. Turning on show move numbers
      labels every piece with the order in which it was placed down,
      and turning on show forced squares shows when a player could
      complete a square by moving at a location.
